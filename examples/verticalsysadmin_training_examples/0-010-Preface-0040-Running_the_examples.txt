.Running the examples

All of the examples are shipped as standalone CFEngine 3 files which
you can run on the command-line by specifying the input filename with
the *-f* switch:

-----
cf-agent -f ./example_115.cf
-----

We recommend adding *-I* to turn on Inform mode, to inform of
changes made to the system.  By default CFEngine won't inform of changes
as reports at scale (e.g. tens of thousands of systems) can be overwhelming.
However, while we are learning, it's nice to see what CFEngine is doing.

Example:
-----
cf-agent -I -f ./example_115.cf
-----
