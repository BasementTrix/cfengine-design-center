.Running the examples

All of the examples are shipped as standalone CFEngine 3 files (*.cf) and are runnable:

-----
cf-agent -I -b example -f ./example_115.cf
-----

[horizontal]

*-f:*:: input filename (make sure to specify the directory, CFEngine doesn't
like to make assumptions, as wrong guesses about infrastructure can be
disastrous)

*-b:*:: list of bundles to run (a bundle is a group of CFEngine policies)

*-I:*:: Inform me of any changes made to the system (by default CFEngine runs
quietly as output can be overwhelming at scale (e.g. from 10,000 systems))


Example:
-----
cf-agent -f \
./030-0005_Basic_Examples:_Files,_Processes,_Commands.__Files._Create_a_file.cf
  -b example -I
