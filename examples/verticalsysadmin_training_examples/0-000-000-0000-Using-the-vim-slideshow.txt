Run the following command to configure your vim to 
load the .vimrc in this directory.

  echo 'set exrc' >> $HOME/.vimrc

Mind there are possibly security implications to implicitly
loading editor settings files from the current working
directory (someone could slip you a malicious file and your
editor would automatically load it).

The .vimrc we ship enables CFEngine syntax highlighting and
has shortcuts:

  SPACE: go forward in the slideshow
  BACKSPACE: go backward in the slideshow
  ff: run current file using cf-agent (mnemonic "file")
  vv: run current file using cf-agent in verbose mode (mnemonic "verbose")
  rr: run current file using /bin/sh (mnemonic "run")

Run the shell script run_slides.sh to start the vim slideshow.
