=== Methods

There is a special promise type in CFEngine 3 called "methods" that promises to call another promise bundle.  

[source,cfengine3,numbered]
-----
 methods:

        "any"

           usebundle => bundle_name;
-----


The promiser can be any word, right now it does not matter; the promiser is reserved for future development.

Parameters are optional:
