Running CFEngine Non-Interactive (as a Service) using promises.cf as input.

. Put your "motd" exercise file under '/var/cfengine/masterfiles/services/'

. Edit '/var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf':
* Add your "motd" exercise file name to "inputs" list
* Add your "motd" exercise bundle name to "bundlesequence" list

. Now let's test it:

-----
    > /etc/motd               # make a repair necessary
    cf-agent -f update.cf -I  # update from "masterfiles" to "inputs"
    cf-agent -I               # make sure /etc/motd is repaired
-----


. Remove your '/etc/motd' and watch CFEngine create '/etc/motd' within 5 minutes:

-----
     watch ls -l /etc/motd 2>/dev/null
-----

Change cf-execd schedule from 5 min to 1 min. 

. in /var/cfengine/masterfiles/controls/cf_execd.cf, set schedule => { "any" }; 
-----
     cf-agent -f update.cf -I
     /etc/init.d/cfengine3 restart
-----
