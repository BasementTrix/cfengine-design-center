# Vertical Sysadmin Training Examples

Welcome to the Vertical Sysadmin Training Examples,
a collection of instructional examples of using 
CFEngine 3 to automate system administration and 
manage knowledge about system configuration.

## Using this collection

Run the following script to configure your vim with syntax
highlighters for CFEngine 3, AsciiDoc, and to load keybindings
for the "vim slideshow" we use in presenting the training
examples:

  $ sh ./0-010-Preface-0050-Install_Vim_Plugin.sh

Run the shell script run_slides.sh to start the vim slideshow,
and use the key bindings:

  SPACE      go forward 
  BACKSPACE  go backward
  ff         run current file using cf-agent (mnemonic "file") in Inform mode
  vv         run current file using cf-agent in verbose mode (mnemonic "verbose")
  rr         run current file using /bin/sh (mnemonic "run")

List files using the l.sh script ("l" for "list")

## Exercises

Run "ls *exr" to list exercises.
