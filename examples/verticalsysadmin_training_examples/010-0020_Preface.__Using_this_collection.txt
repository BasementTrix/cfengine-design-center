The "CFEngine Essentials" course
(formerly known as "Automating System Administration
using CFEngine 3" ) is based on in-class
demonstration of the following examples,
complete with discussion and exercises.

To encourage and support study of CFEngine 3
for those unable to attend our class,
we are making available all the examples and
exercises.

Study the course materials in sequence.
Check them out from GitHub  and list them
with the "l.sh" script.  Try out and run 
the examples.  Modify them and run them again.
Write your own examples.  Do the exercises.

Work your way through the materials until
you understand it all and have done all the
exercises.  Make sure to look up unfamiliar
terms in the Reference Manual.
