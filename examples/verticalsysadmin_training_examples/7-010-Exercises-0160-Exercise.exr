Manually create a template:

-----
echo 'Hello, $(mybundle.myname).  The time is $(sys.date).' > /tmp/file.dat
-----


Note: a fully qualified variable consists of the bundle name wherein the variable is defined plus the variable name.

Example:

-----
    bundle agent mybundle { vars: "myvar" string => "myvalue"; }
-----

The fully qualified variable name is $(mybundle.myvar).


Now write a policy to populate contents of /tmp/file.txt using this template file, /tmp/file.dat.

Make sure your bundle defines the variable embedded in the template, and that your bundle name matches the bundle name embedded in the template.

Your policy should use an edit_lines bundle containing an insert_lines promise with the following attributes:

-----
      insert_type => "file",
      expand_scalars => "true";
-----

If you finish before rest of the group, finish studying the CFEngine Reference Manual chapters 1 -4, and if you finish that, then study the Special Topic guide on Editing File Content.
