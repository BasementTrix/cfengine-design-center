. Use CFEngine to make '/tmp/mirror' contain a copy of '/usr/local/sbin'

(Hint: use a files promise with a copy_from attribute)

. Now create a new file in '/usr/local/sbin' and confirm CFEngine will copy it over.

. Work out how to mirror file removals.  (When a file is removed in '/usr/local/sbin', it should disappear in '/tmp/mirror'.)
