*Problem:* Increase security by ensuring sshd is running with "PermitRootLogin no".

How does the system look like in the correct configuration:

. Make sure '/etc/ssh/sshd_config' contains the line "PermitRootLogin no"

. Make sure sshd is running using this configuration

How to code it in CFEngine:

. a files promise to edit sshd_config

. a commands promise to restart sshd to reload the new config

Exercise:  use the "body classes if_repaired" to link 1 and 2 above to make sure 2 happens.
