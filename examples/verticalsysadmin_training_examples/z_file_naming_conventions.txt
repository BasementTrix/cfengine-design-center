* .exr files are automatically formatted as exercises and numbered
* .sh files are automatically formatted and highlighted
* .pl files are automatically formatted and highlighted
* .cf files are automatically formatted and highlighted
* .txt files are simply processed by asciidoc

-  File naming conventions:
* hyphen (-) is delimiter between fields
* underscore (_) is used as space between words
* dot (.) before extension
* All words in Section and Explanation fields should be capitalized

Examples:
Part     - Chapter      - Section             - File Number      - Subject (optional)                                    . extension (cf|txt|pl|sh|exr)
2         - 080            - Editing_Files      - 0172     - Using_Templates   (Z is placeholder)      . txt

2-080-Editing_Files-0172-Using_Templates.txt
7-999-Last_File-9999-Wrapping_Up_Part_VII.cf
6-600-Exercises-0019-Z.exr

I also plan on renumbering for each Part, Chapter and File Number starting from 0:

7-000-Title-0000-Part_VII.cf

7-999-Last_File-9999-Wrapping_Up_Part_VII.cf

Asciidoc Formatting Use
= Book Title Page
== Parts
=== Chapters
==== Sections

five characters is enough for asciidoc to recognize source blocks for various purposes:
-----
     source
