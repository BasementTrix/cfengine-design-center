. Write a policy to signal TERM and then KILL to any process matching "trn".
. Make a list of processes you don't want to run (let's say "trn" and "eggdrop") and put this list into an slist variable.  Write a promise to signal 'term' and then 'kill' to any process in that list.

  Testing it:

-----
    cp /bin/sleep ~/trn
    ~/trn 1000 &
    cf-agent -f ...
